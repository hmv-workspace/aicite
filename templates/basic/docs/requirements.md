## Document Purpose

> This document defines **WHAT** needs to be built and the **targets/constraints** for Quality Attributes. It is the single source of truth for functional requirements, user stories, and non-functional targets (performance, scalability, security requirements, availability goals).
>
> **For the implementation approach and design decisions, see [architecture.md](./architecture.md).**  
> **For how to implement these requirements, see [implementation.md](./implementation.md).**  
> **For deployment and operational procedures, see [deployment.md](./deployment.md).**

**Intended Audience:** Product Managers, Business Analysts, Architects, Developers, QA Engineers, and AI Agents
