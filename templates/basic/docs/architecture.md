# Architecture Document Template

> **Template Version:** 1.0  
> **Created:** February 2026  
> **Scope:** This template defines the structure for documenting HOW a system is designed and architected. It serves as a single source of truth for architectural overview, components and interactions, design decisions, technology stack, scalability and security approaches, deployment strategy, and maintenance plans. Replace all placeholders (in brackets) with project-specific details.

## Document Purpose

> This document defines **HOW** the system is designed and architected. It is the single source of truth for:
> - Architecture overview, components, and interactions
> - Design decisions and their rationale  
> - Technology Stack (single source of truth)
> - Strategy for scalability, performance, and security ("how designed")
> - High-level deployment strategy and monitoring approach
>
> **For WHAT needs to be built (requirements and targets), see [requirements.md](./requirements.md).**  
> **For HOW to implement it (detailed APIs, database schema, code structure), see [implementation.md](./implementation.md).**  
> **For deployment procedures and operational details, see [deployment.md](./deployment.md).**

**Intended Audience:** Solution Architects, Senior Developers, Tech Leads, DevOps Engineers, and AI Agents

---

## Overview of the Architecture

> Provide a high-level summary of the system architecture, its main purpose, and key characteristics.

**[High-level description of the system architecture, including:]**
- **What the system does**
- **Key architectural patterns or approaches**
- **Primary goals the architecture aims to achieve**
- **Who the primary users are**

---

## Key Components and Their Interactions

> List and describe the main architectural components and how they communicate with each other.

| Component | Description | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| [Component Name 1] | [Description] | [Primary responsibility] |
| [Component Name 2] | [Description] | [Primary responsibility] |
| [Component Name N] | [Description] | [Primary responsibility] |

### Component Interactions

> **Detailed API Specifications and data contracts between components are documented in [implementation.md - API Specifications](./implementation.md#api-specifications).**

**[Description of component interactions and data flows]**

---

## Design Decisions and Rationale

> Document key architectural decisions and explain why they were made.

| Decision | Description | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| [Decision 1] | [What was decided] | [Why this choice was made] |
| [Decision 2] | [What was decided] | [Why this choice was made] |
| [Decision N] | [What was decided] | [Why this choice was made] |

---

## Technology Stack

> **This is the single source of truth for all technology decisions.** All other documents reference this section when discussing specific technologies, frameworks, or tools.
>
> **Detailed implementation guidance for each technology is found in [implementation.md - Technical Implementation Details](./implementation.md#technical-implementation-details).**

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| [Frontend/Backend/Language] | [Technology Name] | [Version] | [Use case] |
| [Database] | [Database Name] | [Version] | [Data storage] |
| [Infrastructure] | [Cloud/Platform] | N/A | [Hosting/Deployment] |
| [Tools] | [Tool Name] | [Version] | [Development/Testing] |

---

## Deployment Strategy

> Describe how the system will be deployed, including environments, CI/CD pipelines, and release processes.

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Deployment Method |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| [Development] | [Purpose] | [Method] |
| [Staging/QA] | [Purpose] | [Method] |
| [Production] | [Purpose] | [Method] |

### Deployment Process

**[Step-by-step deployment process description]**

---

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

> This section describes the **architectural approach** to achieve scalability and performance goals.
> - **Performance targets are defined in [requirements.md - Performance Requirements](./requirements.md#performance-requirements)**
> - **Implementation strategies are detailed in [implementation.md](./implementation.md)**
> - **Monitoring and metrics implementation is in [deployment.md - Monitoring and Observability](./deployment.md#monitoring-and-observability)**

### Scalability

**[Description of scalability approach - horizontal/vertical, partitioning, etc.]**

### Performance

**[Performance requirements and how they are addressed]**

---

## Security Measures

> This section describes the **architectural approach** to implement security.
> - **Security requirements are defined in [requirements.md - Security Requirements](./requirements.md#security-requirements)**
> - **Specific implementation, configuration, and deployment details are in [deployment.md - Security Configuration](./deployment.md#security-configuration)**

| Security Aspect | Design Approach | Implemented In |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Authentication | [Method] | [deployment.md] |
| Authorization | [Method] | [deployment.md] |
| Data Protection | [Encryption/Privacy measures] | [deployment.md] |
| Network Security | [Firewall/VPC/Isolation] | [deployment.md] |
